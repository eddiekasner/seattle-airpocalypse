# Summary

Wildfires in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia resulted in several poor air quality days in the summers of 2017 and 2018. Previously, the term ["airpocalypse" has been used in the headlines](https://abcnews.go.com/International/460-million-chinese-residents-suffering-airpocalypse/story?id=44329107) to describe smog events around the world. In August 2018, the Seattle Times ran a number of articles on the topic:

The [Puget Sound Clean Air Agency](https://www.pscleanair.org/35/About-Us) provides valuable data to protect public health, improve neighborhood air quality, and reduce the regionâ€™s contribution to climate change. According to their monitors (nephalometer), the highest particulat

This report shares my family's findings from an at-home experiment that utilized real-time particle counting with a ([Dylos Air Quality Monitor](http://www.dylosproducts.com/learnabout.html) to evaluate the impact of a [do-it-yourself (DIY) high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/this-diy-air-filter-for-wildfire-smoke-is-less-than-20/281-584346009) described by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.
