# Introduction

Wildfires in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia resulted in several poor air quality days in recent summers. Previously, the term ["airpocalypse" has been used in the headlines](https://abcnews.go.com/International/460-million-chinese-residents-suffering-airpocalypse/story?id=44329107) to describe smog events around the world. In 2018, the Seattle Times ran a number of articles on the topic:

* [Aug 15: Seattle’s dirty air among world’s worst, but relief is in sight](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/smoke-to-clear-up-from-seattle-skies-but-threatens-return-next-week/)
* [Aug 16: As smoke hangs over Northwest study shows air pollution was already high](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/as-smoke-hangs-over-northwest-study-shows-air-pollution-was-already-high/)
* [Aug 19: Seattle pollution levels surge, as smoky air returns through at least Wednesday](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/smoky-air-returns-to-seattle-through-at-least-wednesday/)

The [Puget Sound Clean Air Agency](https://www.pscleanair.org/35/About-Us) collects and provides data to protect public health, improve neighborhood air quality, and reduce the region’s contribution to climate change. According to their monitors (nephalometer), the highest particulates 

This report shares findings from an at-home experiment that utilized real-time particle counting with a ([Dylos Air Quality Monitor](http://www.dylosproducts.com/learnabout.html) to evaluate the impact of a [do-it-yourself (DIY) high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/this-diy-air-filter-for-wildfire-smoke-is-less-than-20/281-584346009) described by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.

# Methods

(ref:airfilter-front) Front of filter. 

```{r airfilter-front, fig.cap='(ref:airfilter-front)', out.width='90%', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/airfilterfront.JPG")
```

(ref:airfilter-back) Back of filter. 

```{r airfilter-back, fig.cap='(ref:airfilter-back)', out.width='90%', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/airfilterback.JPG")
```

# Results

(ref:time-series) Particle count time series for 0.5-1 micron bin. 

```{r time-series, fig.cap='(ref:time-series)', out.width='90%', echo=F}
